# ✈️ SQL — AirlineDB Analysis

This repository contains my SQL solutions for the **AirlineDB** dataset (SkilloVilla).  
Queries answer business questions on bookings, routes, delays, revenue, and load factor.

## 📂 Files
- `queries.sql` — final answers (Q1–Q8)
 
## ✅ Questions Covered
- Q1: Monthly bookings  
- Q2: Top routes by flights  
- Q3: Average arrival delay (mins) by route  
- Q4: Revenue by fare class  
- Q5: Load factor (seat occupancy)  
- Q6: On-time arrival rate (≤15 mins)  
- Q7: Top customers by spend  
- Q8: Most profitable routes

## 🧠 Notes
- Uses tables: `flights`, `bookings`, `tickets`, `ticket_flights`, `boarding_passes`, `airports`, `seats`, `aircrafts`.
- Some queries show airport **codes**; swap to airport **names** by joining `airports`.
